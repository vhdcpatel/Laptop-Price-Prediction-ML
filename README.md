# Laptop-Price-Prediction-ML
ML Algorithms based project to predict price of laptop from some specifications. 

* Based on a specification of the laptop model will provide price prediction using various ML algorithms.
* Machine learning algorithms used: Linear regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
* Make a working model with the Random Forest algorithm with an R2 score of 0.87 using streamlit module.
